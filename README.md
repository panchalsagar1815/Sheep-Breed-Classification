##**Project Title: Sheep Breed Classification**

**Overview:**
The "Sheep Breed Classification" project is centred around the development of an advanced image classification system capable of identifying different breeds of sheep. Leveraging state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning and utilizing the ResNet50 model, this project addresses the unique challenges posed by diverse sheep breeds, contributing to precision livestock farming and genetic research.

**Key Features:**

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:**
   - Curated a comprehensive dataset containing images of various sheep breeds.
   - Applied data cleaning techniques to eliminate outliers, handle missing values, and ensure the dataset's overall integrity.
   - Checked for image quality and consistency to optimize model training.

2. **Normalization and Unnormalization Techniques:**
   - Employed normalization techniques to standardize pixel values, enhancing model convergence and training efficiency.
   - Developed unnormalization techniques to revert processed images to their original format for real-world applications.

3. **Data Shaping, Reshaping, and Scaling:**
   - Applied data shaping and reshaping techniques to standardize image dimensions, ensuring compatibility with the ResNet50 model architecture.
   - Utilized scaling techniques to normalize feature values, optimizing the model's ability to generalize across different sheep breeds.

4. **ResNet50 Model Architecture:**
   - Implemented the ResNet50 model, a deep residual neural network architecture renowned for its ability to handle complex image classification tasks.
   - Fine-tuned the model for the specific requirements of sheep breed classification, adjusting hyperparameters as needed.

5. **Model Architecture Details:**
   - Configured a Sequential model with layers including ResNet50 (Functional) for feature extraction.
   - Incorporated a flattened layer to convert the multi-dimensional output to a one-dimensional array.
   - Utilized a Dense layer for the final classification, with four output nodes corresponding to the different sheep breeds.
